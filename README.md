# Trump_Twitter
It's interesting that twitters posted by Trump are from different Phone --- Iphone or Android.
For the project, we built a model to check whether a particular twitter is posted by Trump himself or not.

We tried different models. Somehow at last, the random forest with pure text data got highest accuracy on the test set. Final code is in the IO.py and rf.py.
